# 2021-04-14 Future Rights

Do you know that you live in an era of kindness, hope and strength? Yes for sure you are bombarded with media reports of despair, disease and discord. At the same time, quietly, deeply and consistently, your world is re-imagining itself so that you and future generations live well and with a deep meaning in your lives.

* Imagine a world where all the people read from the same prayer book
* Imagine a world where all the law makers write laws that allow for the same rights

As unreal as it may seem, such sharing of beliefs and actions is actually happening.

In 2015, representatives of all the 192 member states of the United Nations signed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Agreement. Every nation on Earth is committed to achieving the goals for ourselves today - and for those who follow.  We must be "Meeting our present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"

There are 17 goals. Three very nice goals: No poverty. Quality Education. Gender Equality. All are measurably achievable by the year 2030

The goals are backed by agreed and defined targets that are used to identify progress. Every target has indicators that are used to monitor and measure the progress

The Paris Accord that the United States recently re-agreed to, the move toward electric vehicles and the increase in recycling may all be attributed to the research behind the SDGs.

These goals are not new, a flash in the pan or light-weight. They are a work-in-progress stemming from efforts that began in the 1970s that involve law-making, scientific research and good engineering.

The roots for sustainability were already deep. As Teddy Roosevelt said: “This country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in.” How I can I be happy when others are not?

Even more timeless: the SDGs in essence are a re-wording of the Golden Rule: the principle of treating others as one wants to be treated - a maxim that is found in most religions and cultures. The SDGs provide the tools to monitor, measure and plan for making the rule real. They add dimension by indicating that "others" includes not just family and neighbors. You are to be considerate of everybody alive today - and tomorrow.

Arriving at a place where conscious that your happiness is co-mingled with the happiness of others is not easy to deal with. The SDGs are useful in two ways. They provide ways for you, the organizations you belong to and the world around to to establish priorities, design targets and measure progress. They also may help you identify what you can do and what you cannot do. The SDGs are not the answer to "what is the meaning of life?", but they are 17 steps in the right direction. Can't wait to see where the 2040 goals will take us!
