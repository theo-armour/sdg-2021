## Why

### Rights

UN ~ https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights

>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

Declaration of Independence

>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

US Constitution

>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

### Roosevelt

* The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased and not impaired in value.
* our people should see to it that they [4 parks ] are preserved for their children and their children’s children forever, with their majestic beauty all unmarred.”
* “Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.”
* “This country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in.”


### Brundtland Commission 1987

There are aspects in all our daily lives that involve sustainability

Sustainability: Meeting our present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (Brundtland Commission 1987 - page 16, 39).
