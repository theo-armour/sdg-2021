* "A blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030"
* "17 Goals to Transform Our World. The Sustainable Development Goals are a call for action by all countries – poor, rich and middle-income – to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection. More important than ever, the goals provide a critical framework for COVID-19 recovery."
* "The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests."

The Brundtland Commission ~ _Our Common Future_

* "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".

US Constitution

>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, **and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our _Posterity_**, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

Teddy Roosevelt

* "The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased and not impaired in value."
* "Our people should see to it that they [4 parks ] are preserved for their children and their children’s children forever, with their majestic beauty all unmarred."
* "Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us."
* "This country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in."

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all". The SDGs were set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and are intended to be achieved by the year 2030. They are included in a UN Resolution called the 2030 Agenda or what is colloquially known as Agenda 2030
Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sustainable_Development_Goal_targets_and_indicators
This List of SDG targets and indicators provides a complete overview of all the targets and indicators for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.[1][2] The global indicator framework for Sustainable Development Goals was developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and agreed upon at the 48th session of the United Nations Statistical Commission held in March 2017. The official indicator list below includes all the refinements made up to March 2020.
Background on the Goals
Council on Foreign Relations: https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/sustainable-development-goals

The seventieth UN General Assembly adopted an expansive and ambitious set of development goals that aim to "end poverty in all its forms" by 2030. The seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as the UN's chief initiative for advancing basic living standards in the world and addressing a range of issues, including armed conflict, climate change, and equality. Supporters say this set of nonbinding goals enjoys unprecedented input from governments and NGOs and will "provide the overarching narrative" of sustainable development, while critics say they are too broad, unfocused, and unrealistic.

The metadata available in this repository is a work in progress. It reflects the latest reference metadata information provided by the UN System and other international organizations on data and statistics for the Tier I and II indicators in the global indicator framework. This repository will be further updated and periodically reviewed in cooperation with the respective data compilers.


## Lists of the goals in varying presentations

The SDGs including targets and indicators is comprised of over 250 items. Providing speedy access to all of the elements is a major goal of this projects.
The following sections outline various possible methods for enabling a good user experience

### AirTable

AirTable provides "The power of a database with the familiarity of a spreadsheet. All the power of a flexible relational data model and more. Add fields for attachments, long text notes, checkboxes, links - even barcodes. Surface the data you need, ditch the data you don't."
The following airTable is a free sample from the airTable website.
SDG Base: Sustainable Development Goals - Airtable Universe
A base for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and projects around them. The main table, SDG, is meant to…airtable.com
There is much that could be added here to make a highly interactive and usabler SDGs tool.

### Prezi

Prezi: "Unlike slides, which literally box you in, Prezi gives you a limitless zoomable canvas and the ability to show relationships between the big picture and fine details. The added depth and context makes your message more likely to resonate, motivate, and get remembered, whether it's your bread-and-butter sales pitch, a classroom lecture, or a TED Talk to the world's foremost thinkers."
The following presentation is a sample:

This demo is could be used as the basis to create presentations with many possible interactions.

### HTML, CSS and GitHub Gists

A third approach to presenting the SDGs will be to create access to the goals that is fast, simple and complete using basic HTML and CSS. Posts in Medium cannot have HTML embedded. We provide a simple example using GitHub Gists and HTML <details> tags.
